            Cosmetics designed for skin care can be used to cleanse, exfoliate and protect the skin,
            as well as replenishing it, through the use of cleansers, toners, serums, moisturizers,
            and balms. Cosmetics designed for more general personal care, such as shampoo and body
            wash, can be used to cleanse the body. Cosmetics designed to enhance one's appearance
            (makeup) can be used to conceal blemishes, enhance one's natural features (such as the 
            eyebrows and eyelashes), add color to a person's face and—in the case of more extreme 
            forms of makeup used for performances, fashion shows and people in costume—can be used
            to change the appearance of the face entirely to resemble a different person, creature
            or object. Techniques for changing appearance include contouring, which aims to give
            shape to an area of the face.

            Cosmetics can also be designed to add fragrance to the body.cosmetics trade is one of the
            most active in the world. There are many advantages in using nanoparticles, the main 
            advantages of which are the delivery of interest active cosmetic ingredients into the
            skin, greater stability, lower quantities and minor toxicological mechanisms.
            Nanotechnology has high efficiency in cosmetics. Materials on the nanometre scale have
            a high surface area and consequently have an enhanced effect. In many cases,
            nanotechnology in cosmetics occurs in the form of nanoparticles, which can penetrate
            more deeply into the skin, as they go beyond more epithelial layers, enhancing
            hydrating, antiaging and protective effects (Carrouel et al., 2020). An exciting 
            way to apply nanotechnology in cosmetics is the use of nanoencapsulated materials
